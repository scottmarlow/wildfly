/**
 * ManagementAccess
 *
 * The persistence provider and jipijapa adapters will be in the same classloader,
 * either a static module or included directly in the application.  Those are the two supported use
 * cases for management of deployment persistence units also.
 *
 * From a management point of view, the requirements are:
 *   1.  show management statistics for static persistence provider modules and applications that have
 *       their own persistence provider module.
 *
 *   2.  persistence provider adapters will provide a unique key that identifies the management version of supported
 *       management statistics/operations.  For example, Hibernate 3.x might be 1.0, Hibernate 4.1/4.2 might
 *       be version 2.0 and Hibernate 4.3 could be 2.0 also as long as its compatible (same stats) with 4.1/4.2.
 *       Eventually, a Hibernate (later version) change in statistics is likely to happen, the management version
 *       will be incremented.
